What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Meta data is added to the folder.  It needs to be done so that changes made in 
the repository can be tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? 

The staging area 'contains' the items that have been added to the repository, 
but not yet committed.  The working directory contains all the files in that OS
directory.  They may or may not have been added and/or committed.

What value do you think it offers?

It would seem to give the user additional control over what he/she wants 
associated with each construct, and/or the 'status' they want to give each 
file.

LESSON 3 REFLECTIONS


When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To prevent data loss.
If you're collaborating with others.
If you want others to be able to view the repository for some reason.


-----

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might be working on something locally where you want a branch to remain in it's 
current state.


-----

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?

Branch - a new pathway of commits within a repository

Clone - a copy of a repository including all meta-data.

Fork - a clone, except all done on GitHub.


-----

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored 
locally?

It is available to me when working offline.  Whether just to refer to, or possibly 
to merge if needed.


-----

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? 

Probably with some sort of system of home-grown rules for creating new files and 
folders, and resolving conflicts on a cloud based service.


What would be easier, and what would be harder?

It depends.  If it's something really small, possibly just sharing a file would 
work just fine.  As projects get larger and more people are involved, this 
increases the need for tools for tracking and resolving conflicts.

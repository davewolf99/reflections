LESSON 3 REFLECTIONS


When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To prevent data loss.
If you're collaborating with others.
If you want others to be able to view the repository for some reason.


-----

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might be working on something locally where you want a branch to remain in it's 
current state.
